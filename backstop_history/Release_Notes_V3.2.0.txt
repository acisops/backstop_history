Release Notes for Version 3.2.0 of Backstop History


Change Description
==================

New variations of SI modes, and their associated RTS files,  for Long Term ECS
measurements were created to provide a more flexible chip selection.
Backstop History was updated to incorporate these new RTS files in future
history assemblies.

The added RTS files are:

1_ECS2.RTS
1_ECS3A.RTS
1_ECS3B.RTS
1_ECS4.RTS
1_ECS4ALT.RTS
1_ECS5.RTS
1_ECS6.RTS

Changes to the python files consist mainly of documentation changes. The major
portion of the update is to include the new RTS files in the directory and an update
to a data file.

Testing:
======== 

Unit and regression testing completed, using all the new RTS files,
to assure that the assembled histories correctly contained the commands
from the new RTS files whenever they were used.

Unit tests included:

- Isolated tests of processRTS which reads and process an RTS file to assure the new files
  were correctly read and processed by the code.

- An assembly of the history of the SEP0917 load after an interrupt of the SEP0417
load to assure the assembled history contained the correct RTS commands

Regression testing Loads were full LR runs with checks of the thermal model outputs
and assembled history files to assure correct processing of the new RTS files. Thermal
model outputs were compared to the production load output to check the resultant
change in the thermal response where appropriate.

Loads used for Regression testing:

 - FEB2023B Maneuver-Only load executed after the Full Stop interruption of
   the FEB1323 load.

 - FEB2423A Return to Science load which is a TOO interruption of FEB2023.
 
 - All tests passed.


Interface impacts
