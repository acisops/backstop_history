Release Notes for Version 3.2.0 of Backstop History


Change Description
==================

New variations of SI modes, and their associated RTS files,  for Long Term ECS
measurements were created to provide a more flexible chip selection.
Backstop History was updated to incorporate these new RTS files in future
history assemblies.

The added RTS files are:

1_ECS2.RTS
1_ECS3A.RTS
1_ECS3B.RTS
1_ECS4.RTS
1_ECS4ALT.RTS
1_ECS5.RTS
1_ECS6.RTS

Changes to the python files consist mainly of documentation changes. The major
portion of the update is to include the new RTS files in the directory and an update
to a data file.

Testing:
======== 

Unit and regression testing completed, using all the new RTS files,
to assure that the assembled histories correctly contained the commands
from the new RTS files whenever they were used.

Unit tests included:

- Isolated tests of processRTS, which reads and processes an RTS file, to assure that the new files
  were correctly read and processed by the code.  processRTS is a function located in LTCTI_RTS.py.
  To perform these tests a program was written which created  an instance of LTCTI_RTS.py providing
  access to processRTS. A list of the new RTS file names was also created.  Then, in a loop, processRTS was
  called supplying each RTS name in the list, plus fixed values for the other inputs to processRTS
  ( a CAP number, the length of time for the LTECS run, and a date for the start of the execution
  of the RTS).  The resulting processed RTS file was  displayed and inspected for correctness.
  LTCTI_RTS.py was not changed in this update other than comments and adding whitespace to
  make the code look more tidy.

- An assembly of the history of the SEP0917 load, after an interrupt of the SEP0417
  load, to assure the assembled history contained the correct RTS commands.
  A program used for unit testing created an instance of backstop_history,
  sets the review load directory to /data/acis/LoadReviews/2017/SEP0917/ofls/ and sets a
  tbegin time to assure an assembly of a history that extends to the beginning of the SEP0417 load
  In production, a long term ECS measurement was executed during the shutdown.
  The production NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt file was copied to a test NLET file.
  This file was edited to substitute each new RTS file for the one used in production. Backstop History
  is already set up to accept an NLET file other than the production version.  For each RTS file
  the backstop_history method: Assemble_History(review_load_dir, tbegin) was called.
  The assembled histories were inspected for completeness and correct timing for each new RTS file.  The
  RTS commands had to have the correct time stamps, all commands had to appear, and the commands
  had to appear in the correct time order within the assembled history.

Regression testing Loads were full LR runs with checks of the thermal model outputs
and assembled history files to assure correct processing of the new RTS files. Thermal
model outputs were compared to the production load output to check the resultant
change in the thermal response where appropriate.

Loads used for Regression testing:

 - FEB2023B Maneuver-Only load executed after the Full Stop interruption of
   the FEB1323 load.

 - FEB2423A Return to Science load which is a TOO interruption of FEB2023.
 
 - All tests passed.
