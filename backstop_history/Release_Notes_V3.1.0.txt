Release Notes for Version 3.1 of Backstop History



Change Description
==================

1_ECS4.RTS was substituted for 1_4_CTI.RTS because of the HRC anomaly.
A new method was added to Backstop_History which provides for
extracting, from the supplied command array, all commands that contain
any of the tokens supplied by a token list. An SCS-107 processing error
was fixed.
