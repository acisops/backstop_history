Release Notes for Version 2.1.0 of Backstop History



Change Description
==================

Recently, SCS-106 was updated to leave 3 FEPs on rather than no FEPs on.
SCS-106 is run as part of the SCS-107 sequence. 

Therefore thermal model history assembly requires that this change be reflected
in any shutdown: both science-only shutdowns as well as Full Stops.  Also, the 
ACIS Team recently added new power commands which have to be handled by Backstop History.

These were the drivers for the release of this version of Backstop History. 
Several changes had been underway for some time and are incorporated in this release.

The previous version of Backstop History and acis_thermal_check (ATC) placed a major loop
inside the ACISStateBuilder class of state_builder.py wherein ATC was controlling the assembly
of a backstop history.  Presently, ATC detects when to end the backchaining and also assesses 
the types of loads (Normal, TOO, SCS-107, Full Stop) for each load in the backchain. 
These functions belong inside Backstop History so that All ATC does is request an assembled 
history given the pertinent information needed at the start of the assembly. This was 
removed from ATC and moved into Backstop History. In addition, the need for a function 
to convert backstop commands from a list of dict to a CommandTable is removed.

In the present production version of Backstop History, no record was kept of the assembled history.
In this new version, after a command history has been fully assembled, including any 
necessary command sequences (e.g. LTCTI's, Maneuvers, SCS-107 etc.) a CR*.backstop.hist 
file is written out to the directory of the load under review: the root of the file name
being the same as the review load CR*.backstop file, with ".hist" appended. This .hist file 
is written out in CR*.backstop format and can be run through a model.  This provides
both special case testing (using a test NLET file) as well as a means to check the resultant
output of Backstop History.

CTI command and maneuver templates were removed from the code and transformed into a data file.
This file can be updated as new power commands are created without touching the executable code.
Also one file that contained a variety of command definitions (e.g. AA0000000) is eliminated.
This, in turn eliminated classes and simplified the code.

Methods that were never used in Backstop History were removed.

A local logger was build for Backstop History which will identify the source of the
logger message.  The level of verbosity is captured by ATC and passed to the ACIS state
builder.

Also includes changes John made which make the role of the run_start argument much more clear.
