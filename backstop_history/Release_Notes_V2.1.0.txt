Release Notes for Version 2.1.0 of Backstop History



Change Description
==================

The Shiny release is deprecating Ska.ParseCM and moving towards using kadi for
reading the backstop commands from the load CR*.backstop files. This
change includes alterations to the data structures returned by the call to the kadi.commands.get_cmds_from_backstop method, as compared to the data structures returned by ParseCM.

As Backstop History inserts commends for all Non-Load events, the change
in the data structures necessitated modification of the structure of the
commands which Backstop History inserts into the history. 

Data structure changes also included dictionary keyword case changes. This necessitated changes in the code when those dictionary elements are referenced.

Comments were added and modified for clarification.
