Release Notes for Version 2.0.0 of Backstop History



Change Description
==================

Backstop History recognizes 4 "kinds" of load types: Normal, TOO, SCS-107 and Full Stop.

"Normal": Typical weekly loads where the Review load carries on at 
the end of the Continuity load.

“TOO”:  TOO interrupts the approved load (whether executing or not) in 
the middle of the load, and the review load carries on from that point.

“SCS-107”:  load is a Return To Science (RTS) load which is uploaded after 
an SCS-107 was executed (science halted; vehicle load continues).

“Full Stop”: RTS load which is uploaded after both the science and vehicle 
loads have been halted.

Up until the MAY2620 load, Backstop History looked for Non-Load events 
(e.g. LTCTI measurements, ground commanded maneuvers ) only when a load was 
interrupted by an SCS-107 or Full Stop. And then it only looked for events 
between the stop time and the beginning of the Return To Science (RTS) load.

At the end of May, 2020, we uploaded the MAY2620 Maneuver-Only load after
the MAY2420 load was interrupted by a FULL STOP.  Prior to the start of
the MAY2620 load a LTCTI measurement was initiated. There were no ACIS Stop
Science commands at the start of the MAY2620 load. So if the LTCTI measurement 
was begun such that did not run to completion BEFORE the MAY2620 load was begun, 
it would continue to run, after the MAY2620 load started.

During the MAY2620 load execution a LTCTI measurement was executed. 

The MAY2820 load had 2 ACIS Stop Science commands near the beginning.
This interrupted the LTCTI.

The JUL2720 load was, in all respects, a Normal load executing science 
observations. However there was a "pause" in the science observations, 
built into the load, in order to allow the IRU Swap commanding. During 
this "Science Pause", a LTCTI measurement was executed. A complicating 
factor was that it was not known when, during the pause, the 6 hour 
LTCTI run would be started.  Therefore it was not known whether or 
not it would run to completion or be interrupted by the two ACIS Stop 
Science commands which were part of the JUL2720 load.

The AUG3120 load was another Maneuver-Only load, following an SCS-107 
halt of the AUG2420 load.  The AUG3120 load contained no ACIS commands. 
A WSPOW0002A command was issued, during the AUG3120 load,  via CAP, to 
turn on 3 FEPS. This also is a Non-Load event.

Therefore Backstop History had to be modified to allow any Non-Load event 
to occur in any of the four load "types". In addition the events could 
occur anywhere within the load; may or may not be stopped by commanding in 
the load in which it appears or the following review load.

This update to Backstop History handles all these contingencies.

Testing had to be modified because with the new MP capabilites, each test
must utilize an NLET file as it was at the time the production load was reviewed.

acis_thermal_check needed to be modified as well inorder to accomodate 
the updates in acisops/backstop_history#13.

The ACIS state builder records the end date of the review load in an attribute.

It also improves the acis_thermal_check regression testing framework to allow
for different NLET files in the tests, as well as allow the user to specify a
directory where the test artifacts (e.g. states.dat, temperatures.dat) should be
dumped. By default, these are dumped to a temporary directory, then deleted
after use.  Now the location can be specified for later inspection,
as the files are not deleted.

Interface impacts
=================

There are no interface impacts however this update must be installed at 
the same time as the acis_thermal_check and the model updates listed 
in the Files Changed section above.


Review

Objectives and Results by ACIS Ops


Deployment Plan
===============

Deploy after the first segment of the load presently being reviewed, 
starts execution.
