Release Notes for Version 3.0.1 of Backstop History



Change Description
==================

tbegin is used by backstop_History to know how far back in time to backchain loads.
tbegin is supplied by the user of backstop_History. The Assemble_History method
generated both a DOY and Chandra Seconds version of that time, and rounded the
time off. Rounding is unnecessary and was incorrectly applied in one instance.
The incorrect application did not affect the operation of the program as it was 
done only for logger purposes.

Also the initial logger comment under "debug" was modified.


Comments were added or modified for clarification.
